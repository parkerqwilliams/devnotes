## Notes

### Tags

<!--Tags are used for text, images, and organization on a webpage.
The tag type goes between 2 sets of brackets: <h1> </h1>

header: h1, h2, h3
paragraph: p

Self closing tags are contained within 1 set of brackets: <img/>

image: img

Attributes go after the first bracket tag: <img src"https://www.pictures.com/image.jpg" alt="picture-img"/>

src signifies the image source, and alt provides a read-only description of an image 

Anchor tags are used to redirect. Adding a "target" sends to the actual link rather than, for example, an image by itself.

<a      href="image-address"
        target="_blank"> 
    <p>Click here to redirect</p>
</a>

Inputs are another utility tag (non-text tag) that are self closing. They can prompt user for information or action. Labels are not essential, but help to organize inputs. Inputs will often be followed by a button.

<label>
    <p>Enter text</p>
    <input placeholder="Type here..."/>
</label>
<button>
    <p>Submit</p>
</button> 

Webpages can be organized with container tags, which are used to group together related content. The typography and utility tags within container tags are referred to as "children" and should be indented.

division: div
section: section

Form tags (<form> </form>) are typically used for anything that requires user input.

Making a webpage is like packing a truck, and container tags are essential to organizing information and assigning semantic meaning to each section.
